🏦 Banking & ATM Management SystemA robust Banking Management System developed in C++, designed to simulate essential bank operations and ATM terminal functionalities via a Command Line Interface (CLI). This project utilizes Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles and advanced file handling for persistent data storage.🌟 Key FeaturesThe system is organized into two primary control modules:🛠️ Bank Management Module (Admin)User Registration: Create new accounts with unique ID validation to prevent duplicates.Transaction Handling: Real-time balance updates for deposits and withdrawals.Fund Transfers: Securely move money between existing users.Bill Payments: Integrated payment system that logs history to bill.txt with local system timestamps.Records Management: Full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) capabilities for user profiles.Data Visualization: View all registered user records and payment histories in a formatted list.🏧 ATM Management Module (User)Secure Authentication: Multi-factor login requiring a User ID, 4-digit PIN, and 6-character Password.Masked Input: Sensitive data (PIN/Password) is hidden during entry using asterisks (*) for privacy.Balance Inquiry: Quick access to current funds.ATM Withdrawal: Simplified interface specifically for cash withdrawals.📂 System Architecture & FilesThe application manages data through a local flat-file database system:FilePurposebank.txtPrimary database storing ID, Name, PIN, Password, and Balance.bank1.txtTemporary buffer used for processing transactions and updating records.bill.txtAudit trail for all bill payments, including dates and amounts.🚀 Getting StartedPrerequisitesOperating System: Windows (uses <windows.h> and <conio.h>).Compiler: MinGW / GCC or any C++ compatible IDE (Code::Blocks, Dev-C++, Visual Studio).CompilationBashg++ bank.cpp -o BankSystem.exe
